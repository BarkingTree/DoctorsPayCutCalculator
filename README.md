# PythonPayCalculator

This is a cimple calculator using Streamlit and Python to determine the pay cut faced by NHS Junior Doctors since 2008. 
It accessed the RPI and CPIH Indexes via Office for National Statistics and uses these to compare the change in doctor's pay to inflation. 
Pay Data is read of a JSON file for each country hosted on this GitHub Repositry. These have been created based on the base pay levels recorded in the NHS Medicine Pay Circulars for the associated NHS System. 
Weekend Allowances are also read of the JSON File due to alterations made in 2018 to their value. This is only applicable for those on the 2016 Junior Doctor Contract.
